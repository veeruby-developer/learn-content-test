title: Create a Playground
---

For this workshop, we'll use the Babylon.js playground: <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com">https://playground.babylonjs.com</a>. The Playground provides a browser-based experience for creating with Babylon.js.

The Playground consists of four areas:

<ul>
<li>Menu bar (top)</li>
<li>Links bar (bottom)</li>
<li>Coding editor (left)</li>
<li>Rendering area (right)</li>
</ul>

The space for the coding editor and rendering area can be adjusted by dragging the vertical bar between them.
