# Introduction

Contoso Furnishings, a local home goods store, has hired you to create an app for their store catalog. They'd like the app to enable their customers to do the following:

- Measure their space using an in-app MR ruler
- View and filter a catalog of products
- View products in their space
- Take a photo of products in their space
- View all photos taken within the app

You've decided that Power Apps would be the ideal platform for creating the app. Your task is to create an app for Contoso Furnishings using Power Apps.

## Completed Version

TBD

## Prerequisites

Using the Power Apps platform for this workshop requires that you have access to a sandbox environment. You can get a sandbox environment as part of the M365 Developer Program. Sign-up is free but does require a phone number for authentication to ensure that your account is protected.

Follow the [Setup Sandbox](link) to setup your sandbox environment.
